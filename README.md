===========================================

This cartographer uses the in-game crafted maps to generate a cartography of your Minecraft world.

The output can be :

 - An unique picture
 - Multiple 128px*128px pictures

Requirements
------------

 - Python v3
 - NBT library (included for now)

Roadmap
-------

 - Generate an unique cartography picture
 - Generate a fragmented cartography, for "Google Maps" display behaviour
 - Remove the NBT library from the sources and include it properly
